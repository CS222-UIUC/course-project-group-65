# slayOS_backend

## Set Up Info
- clone/pull from repository
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- start the server from the instructions below

I think this should be enough (all the tutorials were asking for database migrations but we dont have any yet so i think it should be fine) If this doesnt work, then you might need to install django: `pip install django`. Also, if the test.py file gives you trouble, just delete it/comment the whole thing out


Make an app: `python3 manage.py startapp APPNAME`
Migrate from models to migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations APPNAME`
Migrate up to database: `python3 manage.py migrate`

## Models
	


[^note]: depending on some further research and how big the programs will be we might have separate "apps" for expenses, chores, etc. but idk rn so im keeping it all in one for rn.

[^note2]: We can look more into the admin stuff it seems useful in general, but idk if for our project
